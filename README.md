Unit 4 Project: Jimmy Nguyen, Kerry Beth Richardson, Vlad Zborovets

Technologies Used:
------------------
* HTML

* PostgresSQL
* React
* Heroku
* GitHub
* Trello

Approach Taken:
---------------
After we chose a topic, we set up a trello board and pinned all of our initial tasks to the board. We discussed user stories and what we wanted our application to be able to do. After that, we began to divide up the initial work. Vlad tackled the back end, Kerry Beth did the front end, and Jimmy would handle set up for **GitHub** and **Heroku**.
